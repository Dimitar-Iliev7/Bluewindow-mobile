# Responsive Mobile Page with CSS
I try to create a responsive mobile web page created using HTML and CSS. I'm trying to design it to look great on a variety of screen sizes, from small mobile devices to larger desktop displays. Custom CSS Styling: The page is styled using custom CSS, allowing for a unique and visually appealing design.
I think that there are a few elements i must correct in future. I think that there is a problem with the footer. I've tried to make all of the text i one row but when I am trying to center all the items the upper div crashes. Maybe it's because of the relative position again. I've tried my best to use grid and flexbox to show you my skills.  Please feel free to use and modify this code as needed for your own projects. If you have any questions or comments, please don't hesitate to reach out. Thanks for checking out this project!
